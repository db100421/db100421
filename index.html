  <h2>So Here Are My Instructions, In 9 Easy Steps!</h2>
<p>it takes about 40 minutes to make sushi</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<p>4 rolls of sushi-seaweed (nori)<br>
1 cup uncooked sushi rice<br>
1 cup (8fl oz) cold water<br>
2 tablespoons sugar<br>
5 tablespoons mirin or rice vinegar<br>
Meat and/or vegetable your choice (eg. 113g smoked salmon and 1 cucumber sliced lengthwise with 1 avocado, sliced)<br>
Soy sauce and pickled ginger (if you like it)</p>

 <h3>On To Making The Sushi!</h3> 
<p>
  <h4>1</h4> Cook rice in water until it boils. Cover and simmer until grains are soft. Remove from heat and cool.
<h4>2</h4> Meanwhile, chop filling into strips or sticks.
<h4>3</h4> Mix sugar and vinegar. Combine it with cooled rice – this gives it flavour and stickiness.
<h4>4</h4> On your sushi bamboo mat, spread out 1 sheet of nori.
<h4>5</h4> Cover it as thinly as you can with the rice mixture. Leave an uncovered 1" strip of nori along the top edge (to seal the roll).
<h4>6</h4> In the centre of the nori, lay out horizontal lines of your filling (eg. a line of salmon and a line of cucumber). Don’t overload your sushi with filling.
<h4>7</h4> Now for the tricky part. Grip the mat firmly in both hands and roll up sushi as tight as you can. The mat will help you apply even pressure along the roll. Note: don’t roll up the mat into the sushi!
<h4>8</h4> Wet the rice-free strip of nori and ‘glue’ it to the sushi roll.
<h4>9</h4> Chop the roll into 1¼" slices – you’re done!  Repeat steps 4-9 with different fillings for the remaining 3 sheets of nori. You will get better with every roll

<h2>HGF tip</h2>
<p>You will need a special bamboo sushi rolling mat, which you can buy with the nori.

<h3>Sushi Tips</h3>
Which rice?
Unless you’re cooking for your Japanese friends, any white rice will do, but short-grain, sticky rice works best of all.

<h3>What filling?</h3>
avocado slices
canned pineapple chunks
canned tuna
carrot sticks
cream cheese (low-fat)
cucumber sticks
egg omelette cut in strips
ham
pickled gherkin
raw spinach leaves
smoked chicken
smoked salmon
tofu

<h3>I really hate seaweed!</h3>
If you don’t like nori, forget the bamboo mat, too. Simply form little spheres from the rice mixture, flatten them and put the filling on top, like an open sandwich.

<h3>Warning!</h3>
Rice sometimes contains spores of bacteria which cause food poisoning. The spores can survive the cooking, so if the rice is left standing at room temperature, the yucky spores will multiply. It’s best to store cooled rice at less than 4°C.

<h3>Awesome news:</h3> Your sushi will be safe on the day you make it. If you are storing it, remember to store it in the refrigerator.</p>

<h3>Time To Move Onto Me Explaining The History Of Sushi!</h3>
  
<p>The history of sushi (すし, 寿司, 鮨, began with paddy fields, where fish was fermented with vinegar, salt and rice, after which the rice was discarded. The earliest form of the dish, today referred to as narezushi, was created in Japan around the Yayoi period (early Neolithic–early Iron Age). 
  In the Muromachi period (1336–1573), people began to eat rice as well as fish. During the Edo period (1603–1867), vinegar rather than fermented rice began to be used. The dish has become a form of food strongly associated with Japanese culture.
The inventor of modern sushi is believed to be Hanaya Yohei, who invented nigiri-zushi, a type of sushi most known today, in which seafood is placed on hand-pressed vinegared rice, around 1824 in the Edo period. It was the fast food of the chōnin class in the Edo period.
</p>

<p>The earliest form of sushi, a dish today known as narezushi, originated in Southeast Asia where it was made to preserve freshwater fish, possibly in the Mekong River basin, which is now Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand, and in the Irrawaddy River basin, which is now Myanmar.<br>
  Narezushi in ancient China is first documented around the 4th century, when the Han Chinese migrated south to adopt this food from the Baiyue (the original non-Han inhabitants of southern China in the Neolithic, related to modern Southeast Asians).<br>
Similar modern dishes which ferment fish in rice (or other grains) in other Asian rice cultures include burong isda, balao-balao, and tinapayan of the Philippines; pekasam of Indonesia and Malaysia, pla ra (ปลาร้า) of Thailand;<br>
  sikhae (식해) of Korea; and Món cá muối ủ chua, Cá chua, and Cá thính chua of Vietnam.<br>
The prototypical narezushi is made by lacto-fermenting fish with salt and rice in order to control putrefaction. In Japan the dish's distribution overlaps with the introduction of wet-field rice cultivation during the Yayoi period.<br>
